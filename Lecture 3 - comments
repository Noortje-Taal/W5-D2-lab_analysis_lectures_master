**Reference:** [Lies, Damned Lies and Statistics (about TEDTalks)](https://www.ted.com/talks/lies_damned_lies_and_statistics_about_tedtalks#t-316284)

The third lecture is a presentation about the insights gotten from a TED Talks data analysis.

After watching the video...
- What do you think about the visualisations that the speaker used to present his insights? Which one is your favorite?
I think the visualisations were good: clear and simple. For example the 3 topics which he will cover for the ultimate Ted Talk.
He is visualising the results in a way everyone would understand it >> positive about this. 

- What's your opinion about the speech? Did he get his point across?
I think it was very good. I think his purpose was beeiing sarcastic about things you can do with statistics.
Maybe he used very small correlations and lighted them out extremely by telling us funny conclusions. 
But, I also think if you do not have much exerience in dooing research, you may not understand the sarcastic part. 

- Was the presentation about a trascendental topic? Did it keep you glued to the screen?
I think it was. The subject excually wasn't so trascendental, but the way the presented it. I was glued to the screen 
beacuse I really love Ted Talks and I think is it nice that he points out to be critical about statistics and do this with humor.

- Is there anything you think the speaker missed, something he could improve or do yo have some to-do ideas for him?
Maybe ending string with his main point, just very short that everyone knows why he is making this point. 
Furthemore I think his presentations was very good.
